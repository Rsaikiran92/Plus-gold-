            <div className="each-ans">
              <div>
                A gold savings scheme or gold investment scheme is a financial
                instrument that enables individuals to invest in gold
                systematically over a period of time. At Plus Gold, India’s
                first jewellery savings app, we offer various gold schemes to
                cater to the diverse needs of gold investors and buyers with
                varying budgets.
              </div>
              <div>
                These schemes work on the principle of accumulating gold
                gradually, making them accessible to all seeking to invest in
                gold. PlusGold allows investors to choose from different schemes
                like the golden bonanza scheme, wedding saving scheme,
                anniversary gift scheme, gold monthly scheme, and many other
                gold savings schemes, each tailored to suit their preferences
                and financial goals.
              </div>
              <div>
                These schemes often offer flexibility in terms of payment
                frequencies and duration, allowing investors to choose the most
                suitable plan according to their financial capabilities. By
                choosing in a gold savings scheme, individuals can diversify
                their investment portfolio, hedge against inflation, and
                accumulate gold in a disciplined manner, thereby fostering
                long-term financial security,

            <div className="each-qn">Why Invest in Gold?</div>
            <div className="each-ans">
              <div>
                Investing in gold brings several benefits to the table. Here is
                why you should invest in gold:
              </div>
              <div>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>
                  Gold holds its value over time:
                </div>
                <div>
                  Gold is a smart investment because it helps protect your money
                  from losing value when prices go up. While the value of
                  currency goes down as prices of commodities rise, gold’s worth
                  tends to stay steady or even increase, protecting your
                  investment in the long run. That is why investors consider
                  gold as one of the most trusted assets for investment. By
                  investing your hard earned money in gold, you can preserve
                  wealth, ensuring a brighter and more financially secure
                  future.

              <div>
                <div style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>Universal appeal:</div>
                <div>
                  Gold holds universal appeal due to its recognized value across
                  the globe, which distinguishes it from other assets. Its
                  widespread acceptance as a form of investment ensures seamless
                  conversion to cash in different parts of the world. This
                  attribute makes gold a preferred choice for investors seeking
                  liquidity and stability in their portfolios. Additionally, its
                  enduring status as a symbol of wealth and security further
                  solidifies its universal value.
                </div>
              </div>

                <div style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>
                  Higher liquidity than real estate:
                </div>
                <div>
                  While real estate properties appreciate in value over time,
                  selling them at desirable prices may take time, from months to
                  years. But that is not the case with gold even in its physical
                  form. Gold investments provide faster liquidity compared to
                  other physical assets. Additionally, investment in gold comes
                  with no lock-in period except for sovereign gold bonds (SGBs).
                  That means investors can resell gold with ease anytime they
                  need cash.

                <div style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>Easy to Invest:</div>
                <div>
                  Buying gold is like investing your money in something solid
                  like coins or jewellery. While assets stored digitally are
                  susceptible to hacking and other misuse, gold remains safe
                  from such concerns. Plus, investing in gold is easy, and it
                  gives you a sense of security. These attributes make gold a
                  safer and more secure investment.
                </div>

                  Gold gives stable returns:
                </div>
                <div>
                  Gold is a great addition to your investments because it tends
                  to move independently from stocks and bonds. This means that
                  when other investments are doing poorly, gold can help balance
                  out your portfolio and reduce overall risk. By including gold
                  in your investment mix, you can potentially improve your
                  chances of seeing stable returns over time.

            <div className="each-ans">
              <div>
                A gold scheme is more or less similar to a monthly investment
                plan, but it allows investors to buy gold on their investments
                instead of getting interest. It offers a safe avenue for
                portfolio diversification and hedge against inflation.
